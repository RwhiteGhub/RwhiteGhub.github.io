        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>This Blog has a few different pages with a few different purposes. 
            My home page is obviously where you came from, and now your here. 
            I view it as a nice place to land after you find this website. 
            The Blog page is where the meat and potatoes will be, and this is the page 
            I will be updating with pictures, what I want to talk about, latest goals, and achievements. 
            I also added a contact page because as my career moves forward I would like people to be able 
            to contact me about anything in my blog with questions or answers as well as business opportunities.</p>
